Server is prone to sql injections to do it's use of `mysql_query` with user input. The user can embed special characters in their input to escape your statement and execute their own code. As an example suppose we have

    $user = $_POST['username'];
    $pass = $_POST['password'];
    $result = $mysql_query("select * from dbo.user where username='$user' and password='$pass'");

In this case if the user enters `admin'--` as their username it'll end the username quotation marks, and then comment out the rest of the line. In this particular case they could then login as admin without needing the password. Of course this could be avoided by grabbing the user first and then checking the password, but avoiding sql injection like this is difficult, and hard to get right.

User input can be escaped, but doing this is difficult, and bugs arise from the escaping function that cause very serious security flaws. Rather prepared statements should be used. This gives the sql function to the database first, without any user input, which removes any chance for the user to mess with your function. Then afterwards you can give the parameters to the function and execute them.

This also has the added benefit of being able to re-use the prepared statement with different parameters. Since the query is already parsed and compiled, each time you execute with new parameters is much faster than using non-prepared statements. More information about how to use prepared statements is [here](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php).

The following is an example of how to convert the above statement into using a prepared statement (note it requires having created a connection earlier which is stored in $mysqli)
    
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $pass = $_POST['password'];
    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT password FROM dbo.User where username=?");
    $stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
    $stmt->execute();
    $stmt->bind_result($dbPass);
    $stmt->fetch();
    //now dbPass contains the password and the password can be checked
    $stmt->close();//close the statement to regain resources
